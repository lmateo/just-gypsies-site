          <h2>Documentation of the Development Process</h2>
          <p>The intended purpose for this site creation is to give an aesthetic look and feel to advertise horse riding services. My uncle owns a 75 acre farm which houses several Gypsy Vanner horses. He provides private and group lessons to the public. He also employs about five personal professional horse trainers. 
          The site was designed so visitors and or end-users would have the resources to sign up for writing lessons and or other services that the farm provides.</p>
			
			<p>The concept and design of this website was from the perspective of those people who enjoy riding horses especially Gypsies. 
			<br>The steps taken to ensure objectives were met:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create and organize pages needed for the site (home page, about, gallery etc.)</li>
				<li>Develop navigation flow through links and button objects.</li>
				<li>Plan out color schemes and typography for the site.</li>
				<li>Develop header and footer components of the site.
				</ol>
				<b>Components include:</b>
				<ol>
				<li>Logo</li>
				<li>Site Title</li>
				<li>Navigation links to web page</li>
				<li>Copyright year</li>
				<li>Company Name</li>
			</ol>

          <h2>Opportunities for Improvement and Growth
</h2>
          <p>Improvement of the website would be more control over the footer part of the site. I would have like the footer to be located in a fixed position at the bottom of the all pages. I would want greater hover affect control over the header navigation. I would also wanted to make the header more transparent so more content can be shown at the top of the page. Capabilities I would have employed on this site would be to develop the site in a programming language similar to PHP or ASP.net. Connect the site to a database would have more productive for me and I store content and grab it as I needed it.</p>
